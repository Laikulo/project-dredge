## Licensing
All Klipper code (and deriveratives) are licensed under the GPL-3. (see COPYING-gpl3)

The scripts and tools in this repo (that are not part of Klipper) are licensed MIT (see COPYING-mit)

All other documentation that is part of Dredge are licensed under CC-BY-SA (see COPYING-cc)

## Redistrubution
TL;DR: Anything in this repo is redistributable, but firmware itself probably isn't.

Excerpts of GPL3 projects, and patchets related to the same are redistruable under the GPL3.

All of the tooling, scripts, and documentation herein are redistrubtable under the terms of CC-BY-SA or MIT.

The firmware blobs that are automatcailly downloaded, and processed by the workspace tooling are generally not redistributable
as they will likley contain propriatary code from said vendors. (In GPL terms, they are 'amalgam's )

Nothing in the above is legal advise, and project dredge is not licensed to practice law anywhere.
